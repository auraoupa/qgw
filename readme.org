QG code that rely on FFTW for the elliptic solver.

   Compile with 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gcc -O3 -Wall qg.c -o qg.e -lm -lfftw3 -lnetcdf

* QG equations


$$\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = -J(\psi,q) - \beta v + \nu \Delta q$$

* Discretization

Variables are discretized at cell corner.

to access the value of a field at index i,j, one uses 

p[idx(i,j)]

This may simplify or complexify the move to MPI

* Boundary conditions


- bc_fac is a parameter that controls the type of boundary conditions:
- bc_fac = 0      -> free slip BC (default)
- bc_fac = [0..1] -> partial slip
- bc_fac = 1      -> no slip BC
- bc_fac = -1     -> periodic BC (experimental)
